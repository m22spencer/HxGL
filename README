GLES20.cpp/h is currently the only supported graphics wrapper.

All extern calls should be done via [hxgl.core.HXGL]. Never bypass directly with Lib.load.

Required libs for hxgl.ndll:
	sfml-window
	sfml-system

Common Problems:
	Windows:
		Window loads and immediately crashes: Compile with vstudio 2008
		hxgl_*_* not found: Place hxgl.ndll into bin/c++
	Linux: 
		SFML 1.6 fails on a symbol error, no fix yet. Use SFML 1.5
		hxgl_*_* not found: Move hxgl.ndll to /lib
		        (Still failing? export LD_DEBUG=libs and run again)

NME:
	Some recent changes heavily break nme support.
	A fix is coming.

flash.display3D.*:
    Functional, but very limited.

Differences:
	Still need GLSL target. Waiting on HxSL extension.
	
Compiling:
	Use latest HaXe/HXCPP nightlies.
