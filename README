IF YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO 2010 YOU MUST COMPILE SFML FROM SOURCE!

GLES20.cpp/h is currently the only supported graphics wrapper.

All extern calls should be done via [hxgl.core.HXGL]. Never bypass directly with Lib.load.

Android:
    Android templates coming soon!

Required libs for hxgl.ndll:
	sfml-window
	sfml-system
	glew32

Common Problems:
	Windows:
		Window loads and immediately crashes: Compile with vstudio 2008
		hxgl_*_* not found: Place hxgl.ndll into bin/c++
	Linux: 
		SFML 1.6 fails on a symbol error, no fix yet. Use SFML 1.5
		hxgl_*_* not found: Move hxgl.ndll to /lib
		        (Still failing? export LD_DEBUG=libs and run again)

NME:
	Some recent changes heavily break nme support.
	A fix is coming.

Differences:
	Vector.ofArray ()  requires  Using hxgl.Vector.Vector_USING;

	stage3DS[n] is not supported use:
		Using hxgl.display.Stage3D.Stage3DTools;
		s = Stage3D.getStage3D (n);
		
	setVertexBufferAt (... does not support _HINTS_ in flash);
	
	Still need HxSL target. Waiting on HxSL extension.

Hinting:
   	setVertexBufferAt (default_params...., hxgl.core.GLEnums._HINT_);
   
   	You can suppply a hint with your buffer binds to tell fixed function
   	where to place the buffer and whether or not to use it.

   	This method will be obsolete soon.
	
Compiling:
	Use latest HaXe/HXCPP nightlies.
